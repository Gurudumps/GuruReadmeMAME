Notes:

In MAME someone byte-swapped all of the the EEPROM files (located at 25C) and they do not work on real hardware. If you are
programming the EEPROM dump to a real chip you must byte-swap the dump otherwise it will not work on your PCB. This note
will be removed when someone fixes the problem.

The Tokimeki Memorial Oshiete Your Heart games use an extra PCB plugged in on top for controlling the printer and the sensors.
Additionally, there is a small PCB for connecting to a sensor... PCB number GE755-PWB(S)

Simpsons Bowling uses an extra PCB plugged in on top containing flash ROMs and circuitry to control the trackball.

Some of the other games may also have extra PCBs.

Notes:

      - These two PCBs are functionally equivalent and can be exchanged between games and work fine (see CD-swapping note below).

      - Simpsons Bowling and Dead Eye use a GV999 with a daughtercard containing flash ROMs and CPLDs:
        PWB402610
        Xilinx XC3020A
        Xilinx 1718DPC
        74F244N (2 of these)
        LVT245SS (2 of theses)
        On Simpsons Bowling, this also has one ÂµPD4701AC and an empty space for a second.

      - 000180 is used for driving the RGB output. It's a very thin piece of very brittle ceramic
        containing a circuit, a LM1203 chip, some smt transistors/caps/resistors etc (let's just say
        placing this thing on the edge of the PCB wasn't a good design choice!)
        On GV999, it has been replaced by three transistors and a MC44200.

      - 056602 seems to be some sort of A/D converter (another ceramic thing containing caps/resistors/transistors and a chip)

      - CXD2922 and CXD2925 are SPU's.

      - The BIOS on ZV610 and GV999 is identical. It's a 4M mask ROM, compatible with 27C040.

      - The CD contains one MODE 1 data track and several Redbook audio tracks which are streamed to the speaker via CN8.

      - The ZV and GV PCB's are virtually identical aside from some minor component shuffling and the RGB output mechanism.
        However note that the GPU revision is different between the two boards and so are some of the other Sony IC's.

      - CN8 used to connect redbook audio output from CD drive to PCB.

      - CN6 used to connect power to CD drive.

      - CN2 used for extra speaker connection for stereo output.

      - CN3, CN5 used for connecting 3rd and 4th player controls.

      - CN4 is present only on GV999 and is used to connect extra PCBs with additional functionality.
        For example:
        Simpsons Bowling additional flash ROM & trackball control PCB.
        Tokimeki Memorial Oshiete Your Heart printer and sensor control PCB.

      - 001231, 058239 are PALCE16V8H PALs.

      - 10E, 12E are unpopulated positions for 16M TSOP56 FLASHROMs (10E is 9E on GV999).

      - If the CD is swapped to another GV game, the game will boot but will stop with an error '25C MBAD' (the EEPROM is 25C)
        So the games can not be swapped by simply exchanging CDs because the EEPROM will not re-init itself if the CDROM is swapped.
        This appears to be some form of mild protection to stop operators swapping CD's.
        However it is possible to swap games to another PCB by exchanging the CD _AND_ the EEPROM from another PCB which belongs
        to that same game. It won't work with a blank EEPROM or a different games' EEPROM.
