This is an archive of all of the Guru-Readme's (tm)(c)(r) that I have created since I began working on MAME around 2000. These readme's will be updated from time to time without notice as I see fit. All of the Guru-Readme's here are the newest versions available and superceed any other Guru-Readme's found in other Github repositories.
Having these files in my Github means I have full control over editing, including doing minor changes or fixing typos and/or formatting errors so that I don't have to bug other people to make those minor changes or do pull requests.

The directory structure and file names here follow the MAME source directory structure with one important change. Github has a limit of 1000 files viewable in any directory which makes it impossible to browse all the files when there are more than 1000 files in a directory. The drivers directory is one such directory and this is the main directory I am concerned about. To allow me to browse and edit these files online through the Github web UI I have added manufacturer directories. This is something that was suggested by me and discussed very briefly by the team many years ago but due to apathy and the inability within MAMEDev management to make a decision and most people leaving the team, was either too difficult for them to incorportate or they were simply too lazy to do it or they simply didn't care enough to correctly manage and organise the source driver directory. The result is I had to take matters into my own hands and I have just done it. Specific game drivers are now much easier to find and all files are actually listed on github now. Problem solved.

I hereby give permission that the information presented here in my Guru-Readme(tm)(c)(r) files can be incorporated back into MAME into the same source file as I have listed here, as long as the information is not modified and the 'Hardware info by Guru' credit remains intact. When my work is added to MAME you must credit me as 'Guru' in the github commit and contact me via email to notify me that my work has been added to MAME. This is a simple courtesy to show that you acknowledge my work. This credit is sadly lacking in most drivers and anyone casually viewing the driver source code would think the person who wrote the driver (the C++ code) was the author of the hardware documentation. In almost all cases this is not true and the hardware documentation was authored by a different person. This documentation took in some cases many hours, days or months to complete and it is important for people to know where this info originated from and that proper credit is given. 

This archive contains only documentation created by me (Guru), but like source code, if you edit my readme and add more info, the readme is still mine. 

The archive serves as an all-in-one place for me to quickly find and update my hardware documentation readme files. This is usually done when PCBs are first dumped or when PCBs I own are sold, since after that point there is no further opportunity for me to reference the real hardware.

Most readme's are the same as when captured from the MAME source code on 20th April 2021. Where the readme says 'Last update: No changes', it means the readme is the same as the source code in MAME on this date. When the readme has a date listed after 'Last Update:', it means there were changes done that are likely not in the current version of MAME. The changes could be major or a simple full stop addition or typo correction.

If hardware info is required to improve MAME you can make a direct request via email and I can make a readme for any PCB I have in my possession.
The list of PCBs I currently have is available on my website at the following link....

Note almost all of them are for sale so if you want info, request it before the PCB is sold.
