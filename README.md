This is an archive of all of the Guru-Readme's (tm)(c)(r) that I have created since I began working on MAME around 2000. These readme's will be updated from time to time without notice as I see fit. The Guru-Readme's here are the newest version available and superceed any other Guru-Readme's found in other Github repositories.

The directory structure and file names here follow the MAME source directory structure with one important change. Github has a limit of 1000 files viewable in any directory which makes it impossible to browse all the files when there are more than 1000 files in a directory. The drivers directory is one such directory and this is the main directory I am concerned about. To allow me to browse and edit these files online through the Github web UI I have added manufacturer directories. This is something that was discussed many years ago but due to apathy with MAMEDev management and most people leaving the team, was either too difficult for MAMEDev to incorportate or they were simply too lazy to impliment it. The result is I had to take matters into my own hands and I have just done it. Problem solved.

The information presented here in my Guru-Readme(tm)(c)(r) files can be incorporated back into MAME as long as they are not modified and the 'Hardware info by Guru' credit remains intact. This credit is sadly lacking in ost drivers and anyone casually viewing the driver would think the person who wrote the driver (the C++ code) was the author of the hardware documentation. In almost all cases this is not true and the hardware documentation was authored by a different person. As you can see from this archive, many of them were created by me.
