This is an archive of all of the Guru-Readme's (tm)(c)(r) that I have created since I began working on MAME around 2000. These readme's will be updated from time to time without notice as I see fit. The Guru-Readme's here are the newest version available and superceed any other Guru-Readme's found in other Github repositories.

The directory structure here follows the MAME source directory structure with one important change. Github has a limit of 1000 files viewable in any directory which makes it impossible to browse all the files when there are more than 1000 files in a directory. The drivers directory is one such directory and this is the main directory I am concerned about. To allow me to browse and edit these files online through the Github web UI I have added manufacturer directories. This is something that was discussed many years ago but is seemingly too difficult for MAMEDev to incorportate, so I have just done it. Problem solved.
